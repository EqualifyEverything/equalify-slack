I'm open to collaboration and all the things\/Zoom\/screenshare either asynchronous or real-time depending on who's working on this! The stats are basically identical except I think it's now on Chrome 122 something--can get exact number if needed:\n\n• Still issues with receiving pw reset email. Not sure if it's the email domain (a .edu in this case) or on the Equalify backend somewhere. Can try to help troubleshoot further.\n• Settings\/Add Property: This appears in the title of the page: \"  \n    *Warning*: Undefined variable $property_name in *\/workspace\/helpers\/get_page_title.php* on line *45*  \n    Property Settings | Equalify\".\n• Settings\/Add Property: The Sitemap URL text field has a note after the label about the requirement for the URL to follow specific schema, but that message isn't programmatically associated with the text field, so tabbing past the text field i.e. the next focusable element you land on the link called \"XML Sitemap schema\" without the appropriate context.\n• Pressed button Process 20 Scans. Like in V1RC3, after the scans are processed, the screen reader begins reading off the entire list of results in one contiguous chunk. In the case of this testing that was a list of 16. That's overwhelming and way too verbose. I recommend just having some messaging that \"x\" number of scans completed, provide a semantic heading for the user to easily jump to the results on their accord, and inform of the heading in the message. It so happened I stopped it speaking after the fifth or sixth item and was looking for the results which I assumed would be preceded by a heading. When that wasn't the case, I encountered the button to process 20 scans again. Not a11y per se, but it could be a little misleading for someone if they're not sure that the scan already completed, maybe they missed the alert (stopped the screen reader\/was doing something else and missed it, etc).\n• Reports\/New Report: Title page is too generic, \"Equalify | Accessibility Issue Management\".\n• Reports\/New Report: After updating the report title the focus still resets. This might be a JAWS issue because that continues to be okay on NVDA and the focus continues (see the note in v1rc3 doc but basically the next tab press moves you in tab order as expected rather than back to the skp link). For example, after the title is updated and the alert fires, pressing tab, expecting to continue progressing through the form, the next tab press is on the skip link and you essentially have to work you way all the way back to the form to pick back up where you left off.\n• Reports\/Add Report\/Add Filter: The field \"search and select filter values\" always says \"no search results\" when the user tabs onto it. A user might think there aren't any results. I recommend a clearer message instructing the user to type and that results will appear they can use the up and down arrow keys.\n• When searching to filter by property, you're told how many results there are but not how to access them. Recommend a quick tip how using the arrow keys\/press entr to select.\n• After removing the filter, an alert is spoken that the changes were successful, though there's no change--it needs to be clearer and tell the user the removal, not change, was successful.",

                "text": "This stems from the recent chat on the a11y channel of our Slack (cc <https:\/\/github.com\/wilsuriel03|@wilsuriel03> & <https:\/\/github.com\/heythisischris|@heythisischris>.\n\n*Stats*\n\n• Windows 11,\n• Google Chrome Version 125.0.6422.61\n• JAWS 2024.2312.53.400,\n• NVDA 2024.1\n• Equalify.dev 0.3.0 Developer Preview\n\nIf any of the issues are particular to a browser, I make that clear, though that wasn't the case here.\n\n*Results*\n*Signup\/signin*\n\n• Signin page uses placeholder for the email. you shouldn't use placeholder text here --that really goes for any input field. These tend to introduce color contrast issues. Also the placeholder will disappear as soon as text is entered, so you should consider wrapping it in a p tag and associate it with the input using aria-describedby.\n• On the signup page, <https:\/\/equalify.dev\/signup|https:\/\/equalify.dev\/signup>, the first field is read as \"email first name\". Next field appears to read helper text as the label for the first name only rather than explicitly saying \"first name\".\n• When attempting to sign up, after pressing Continue, my focus jumped back to the confirm password field but there was no context around the issue. It needs to communicate to the user that the passwords don't match, in this case. In other UIs it might be that the password wasn't strong enough, didn't contain the required character types, etc. Communicating the issue eliminates any of the ambiguity. You could consider comparing the two password fields before the user presses Continue if then once they've entered into the confirm field, wait a beat and confirm whether or not the passwords match so they don't have to go backward through the DOM and guess what the issue was, creating additional work for them and disrupting the workflow.\n• After pressing Continue, I did receive the verification code, but there seemed to be stale content from earlier when I tried signing in with my email. If it confused me, it will most certainly confuse other users.\n\n*Main screen after logging in\/Reports*\n\n• Navigation in the main navigation landmark label which is redundant. It reads as \"main navigation navigation\".\n• View Report link is redundant, especially if the user navigates via the tab key or pulls up a links list, which is a common feature of most modern screen readers. It lacks context pertaining to which report is being viewed. E.g. change the link text to \"View Accessibility 1 Report\". Make sure the accessible name and visible label match if at all possible. This is important for two reasons:\n    • Speech-input users can directly activate controls on a page with fewer surprising changes of focus, and\n    • text-to-speech users will have a better experience because the labels that they hear match the visible text labels that they see on the screen.\n• Viewing a report, in this case Accessibility Audit 1, there are a variety of graphics before the message table with generic-sounding alt text whose purpose is unclear: \"2021\/01\", \"2021\/02\", \"2021\/03\", \"2021\/04\", \"2021\/05\", \"0\", \"8\", \"16\", \"24\", and \"32\"\".\n• Report\/edit\/danger zone: When closing\/cancelling deletion, screen reader focus is unclear and focus should return to the button that initiated the dialog in this case being the delete button.\n• Searching any of the selected filter types does not announce the search result even if no items are found.\n• When creating a report, the report name text field is unavailable.\n\nThis random one I didn't know how to categorize: When going to Properties I receive the messsage \"Error loading properties\".",
