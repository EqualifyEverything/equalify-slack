While it’s certainly possible to set up a standalone React app from scratch, I have reconsidered and think it would be smarter both in the immediate and in the long run to use Next.js.\n\nSome reasons:\n\n*Sustainability and Future-proofing*: With CRA being deprecated, it’s clear that the ecosystem is moving towards more integrated solutions. Next.js is actively maintained, offering long-term sustainability and aligning with modern web development practices. Any new releases of React or other tools will likely be made with the assumption that a framework will be used\n\n*Improved Documentation and Community Support*: Future devs working on the project will most likely find more and better resources for a Next.js app than a standalone React one.\n\n*Handling Complexity*: Equalify’s number of features and therefore its complexity are growing rapidly. Next.js provides tools to handle complex API interactions and things like dynamic content rendering.\n\n*Developer experience*: Particularly without CRA, Next.js is much easier to set up than a standalone React app. Also, there are a ton of features and optimizations that make the development more speedy.\n\n*SEO*: Server side rendering is good for SEO, client side is not.\n\n*RESERVATIONS*:\n\n*Hosting*: Really my only concern now about using Next is that is would require a separate server than the PHP one. Which shouldn’t be too much of a problem, it’s very easy to host on Next on Vercel, which comes with automatic optimizations like deployment previews, auto-scaling, load-balancing, etc.\n\nI’m feeling pretty strongly that Next is the way to go on this, but I am open to discussion.
