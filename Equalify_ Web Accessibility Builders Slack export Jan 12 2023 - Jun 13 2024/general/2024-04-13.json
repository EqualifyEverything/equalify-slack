Woo!\n• <@U06TJNUDNLA> joined the <#C06RS373V6G|build-frontend> team and will have some updates soon!\n• A lot of momentum in <#C06R2TJM562|build-api> — I recommend checking out the channel to read up on what’s been going on (I’m working on learning about all the projects so I can better translate the updates in future posts!)\nHave a great weekend! Will check in next Thursday and report every Friday starting next week — feel free to send me updates throughout the week, however, if that makes sense for your schedules. Thanks all!",
